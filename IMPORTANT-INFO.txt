The one uploaded by regginator is most likely a cookie logger! Check the folders all you want, there is a malicious part that is disguised as a keyframe called "dumbass" that literally attaches to your browser and searches for cookies on the website roblox.com!
Can you people not connect the dots with the literal part that says "Cookies" and adds info from your browser to another hidden github?!
You guys have a deathwish! You keep playing it off and hiding behind "lOoK iNSiDe tHe fOldEr" when the option keylogs you and adds to that textfile, replacing "no" with all of your cookies!
Do you not see the amount of exploiter's accounts being turned into "Jailbroken" and then make innapropriate models that get the account banned?
Granted, most of you are kids who are tired of using JJSploit or Synapse X cracked... But you have to be smart this time! Would you rather use a simple key system, or have the key to your account stolen every time you launch CE?!
I cannot warn you ANY FURTHUR than this except for literally coming to your individual houses and slapping you across the face, back into reality.
IT
IS
NOT
WORTH
IT!
DO YOU NOT SEE THE "WARNING!! DO NOT SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE" AT THE  INSPECT ELEMENT? DO YOU EVEN LOOK INSIDE SCRIPTS TO SEE OBVIOUS MALICIOUS CODE? DO YOU PEOPLE EVEN HAVE BRAINS? DO YOU EVEN EXIST?
I dare you, ignore  my warning some more. Watch as your account fades away.

Regginator wants you to ignore my warning, and you most likely will.
Your account will not be left still.
